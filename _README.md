### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

After completing a double Masterâ€™s degree in [Multimedia Engineering](https://didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/ingegneria_cinema/en/presentation), I couldn't resist the charm of the Web and joined [Toaster](http://toaster.co/) â€” a global digital agency. Across six years, I have worked in the London HQ and the Singapore office as Lead Web Developer. I've since worked on many high-profile projects from clients like [Google](https://about.google/) and the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/). I successiviely joined [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) as a full-time JavaScrip engineer in the summer of 2020 to help to improve the WordPress platform and move forward the Gutenberg project.

**Ultimately, I am a maker. I like to build, tinker and understand how things work. I prioritise accessibility and performance, above all.** Besides coding, I have helped co-organise the [PWA London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PWALondon/), Iâ€™ve given a few talks (like [this one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dh-DJtRtZ38vkoPoaKMUiUFtCmqWHP_xxzF6y0Xcpfo/edit?usp=sharing), [this one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ps_NAbf07dOcjv_emIMpE5B9hqEIRtwvCAfMcUS_I_Y/edit?usp=sharing) or [this one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NkDA8dLu9nttky9tei_xFYLGMWYBwAOv8O7caeCxB_c/edit?usp=sharing)) and I've written a couple of articles (like [this one](https://toaster.co/thoughts/getting-started-with-service-workers)).

In my free time, I engage in DIY projects, play football and make electronic music. I speak Italian, English and French. I love travelling and I dream of having a little wood and leather workshop.
